# DINOv3 Research & Experiments

This repository contains research experiments and analysis using **DINOv3**, a self-supervised vision transformer model, for representation learning and downstream computer vision tasks.

The goal of this project is to explore how large-scale self-supervised vision models can be adapted, fine-tuned, and evaluated for practical and research-oriented applications.

---

## Overview

**DINOv3** is a self-supervised learning framework that learns strong visual representations without labeled data. This repository focuses on:

- Understanding DINOv3 internals and training dynamics  
- Extracting and visualizing learned embeddings  
- Evaluating representations on downstream tasks  
- Experimenting with fine-tuning strategies and feature probing  

This project is research-oriented and intended for experimentation rather than production deployment.

## Key Features

- Self-supervised feature extraction using DINOv3
- Embedding visualization and analysis
- Linear probing / downstream evaluation
- Modular experimentation pipeline
